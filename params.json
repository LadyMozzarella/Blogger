I didn't get to attempting to implement sessions, so the user must enter username and password upon creating every post and comment.\r\n\r\n##Pages\r\n + The index page shows the posts listed beginning with the most recent at the top.\r\n + There's a create user page.\r\n + Creating a post as well as a comment require username and password. (Currently breaks if the log in information isn't correct... as well as on the user creation page.)\r\n + Creating comments is done on the individual post page.\r\n \r\n##Styling\r\nThe design is super bootstrap.\r\n\r\n##Database\r\nThe database is H2 (SQL, in-memory)\r\n\r\n##Commands to get it up and running\r\n+ Clone this repository\r\n\r\n+ Run Maven\r\n```\r\nmvn package\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Setup H2 Database\r\n```\r\njava -jar target/dBlogger-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar db migrate Blogger.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Run Server\r\n```\r\njava -jar target/Blogger-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar server Blogger.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ View at http://localhost:8080\r\n\r\n\r\n###Homepage\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/H7EuvY8.png](https://i.imgur.com/H7EuvY8.png)\r\n\r\n###User Sign Up\r\n![http://i.imgur.com/CVhVOvY.png](http://i.imgur.com/CVhVOvY.png)\r\n\r\n###Create a Post\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/MtEvTZR.png](https://i.imgur.com/MtEvTZR.png)\r\n\r\n###View a Post, or Post a Comment\r\n![https://i.imgur.com/1GU5Hry.png](https://i.imgur.com/1GU5Hry.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
